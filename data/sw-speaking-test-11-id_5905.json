    "Good afternoon everybody, and thank you for flying with West Air. My name is Paula Griggs, and I’m the head flight attendant on today’s aircraft. If you have any questions during your flight, please don't hesitate to ask me or one of the other attendants for assistance. The pilot is preparing the plane for takeoff, so this is an excellent opportunity to review the in-flight safety guidelines. Please take the time to study the material stored in front of your seat. Thank you.",
