    "Hi. This is Myra Peters calling about my appointment with Dr. Jones. I have a three o’clock appointment scheduled for this afternoon. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to keep it because of an important meeting at work. So, I’ll need to reschedule. I was hoping to come in sometime next week. Any time Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday afternoon would work for me. I hope the doctor has some time available on one of those days. Please call me back and let me know.",
