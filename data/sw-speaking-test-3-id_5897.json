    "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the county fair! It's wonderful to have you here today as we celebrate the 120th anniversary of our city. We commemorate this day with great pride. Please make sure you visit the exhibits and game booths. Later today there will be competitive events, such as our famous pie-baking contest. I strongly suggest that you get over to the pie table early, or there might not be anything left. It is also my pleasure to introduce you to our mayor, Mr. James Moon. Mr. Moon will lead us in singing our national anthem. Then we’ll begin the festivities.",
